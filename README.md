# Bus Route Management System

This project is a simple Bus Route Management System implemented in C using a doubly linked list.  
It allows users to manage bus stations dynamically by adding, inserting, deleting, displaying, and searching stations in the route.

## Features

1. Add bus station at the end
2. Add bus station at a specific position
3. Delete a station by name
4. Display route from start to end
5. Display route from end to start
6. Search for a station in the route
7. Doubly Linked List implementation for smooth forward and backward traversal

## How it Works

Each station is stored in a doubly linked list node with the station name and two pointers:
- Previous station
- Next station

The list supports insertion at the beginning, middle, or end, as well as deletion of any node.  
Routes can be displayed in both forward and backward directions.

## Compilation

Use any C compiler such as GCC:


## Run the Program


## File Structure

- `bus.c` : Main source file containing all operations and menu-driven interface.
- No additional dependencies or external libraries required.

## Suitable For

- Data Structures lab programs
- Doubly Linked List implementation practice
- Small academic demonstrations or mini-projects
